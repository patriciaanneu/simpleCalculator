# Lab Assignment #1 - Simple Calculator

**Purpose:** The purpose of the Lab is to:
  - Design and develop Applications that incorporate concepts such as:
      - Data type
      - Expression
      - DOM

Be sure to read the following general instructions carefully:
  - This assignment must be completed individually by all the students.
  - You will have to upload the solution on luminate.

**Exercise**<br>
Create a calculator application that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) using a function with parameters and expression. Write the logic in an external JavaScript file.
1. Create an **HTML file** with the following:
   - A dropdown to select an operation (e.g., addition, subtraction)
   - Two input fields to enter numbers
   - A button to calculate the result
   - A paragraph to display the result
2. Create an external JavaScript file named calculator.js.
3. In calculator.js, write a function name calculate:
   - The function should take three parameters:
       1. num1 (first number)
       2. num2 (second number)
       3. operation (the arithmetic operation: "add", "subtract", "multiply", or "divide")
   - Use expressions (+, -, *, /) to perform the calculation based on the operation parameter
   - Return the result
4. Use the DOM manipulation to:
   - Get values from the input fields and dropdown.
   - Display the calculated result in the paragraph.
